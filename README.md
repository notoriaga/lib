# Introduction


StdLib is the *fastest, easiest* way to turn functions into infinitely scalable,
self-healing web services. It has three components:

1. A central registry for microservices
2. A distribution platform for hosting at scale
3. A development framework for package management and service creation

StdLib is based on Function as a Service ("server-less") architecture,
popularized by AWS Lambda. You can use StdLib to build modular, scalable web services
for yourself and other developers in *minutes* without having to manage servers,
gateways, domains, write documentation, or build SDKs. Your development workflow
has never been easier - focus on writing code you love, let StdLib handle
everything else.

StdLib uses an **open specification** called
[FaaSlang](https://github.com/faaslang/faaslang) for function definitions and
execution - if you run into concerns or questions as you're building from this
guide, please reference the FaaSlang repository. :)

You can view services published by our large and growing developer community
[on the StdLib search page](https://stdlib.com/search).

# Getting Started

To get started with StdLib, first make sure you have Node 6.x installed,
[available from the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org). Next install
the StdLib CLI tools with:

```
$ npm install lib.cli -g
```

And you're now ready to start building!

# Upgrading From Previous Versions

If you're running a previous version of StdLib and having issues with the CLI,
try cleaning up the old CLI binary links first;

```
$ rm /usr/local/bin/f
$ rm /usr/local/bin/lib
$ rm /usr/local/bin/stdlib
```

# Creating Your First Service

The first thing you'll want to do is create a workspace. Create a new directory
you intend to build your services in and initialize the workspace.

```
$ mkdir stdlib-workspace
$ cd stdlib-workspace
$ lib init
```

You'll be asked for an e-mail address to log in to the StdLib registry.
If you don't yet have an account, you can create one from the command line.
Note that you can skip account creation with `lib init --no-login`.
You'll be unable to use the registry, but it's useful for creating workspaces
when you don't have internet access.

Next, create your service:

```
$ lib create <service>
```

You'll be asked for a default function name, which is the entry point
into your service (useful if you only want a single entry point). This will automatically
generate a service project scaffold in `stdlib-workspace/<username>/<service>`.

Once created, enter the service directory:

```
$ cd your-username/your-service
```

In this directory, you'll see something like:

```
- functions/
  - __main__.js
- package.json
- env.json
- WELCOME.md
- README.md
```

At this point, there's a "hello world" function that's been automatically
created (`__main__.js`). StdLib comes paired with a simple `lib` command for
testing your functions locally and running them in the cloud.
To test your function:

```shell
$ lib .
"hello world"
```

If we examine the `functions/__main__.js` file, we see the following:

```javascript
/**
* A basic Hello World function
* @param {string} name Who you're saying hello to
* @returns {string}
*/
module.exports = (name = 'world', context, callback) => {
  callback(null, `hello ${name}`);
};
```

We can pass parameters to it using the CLI, either in order:

```shell
$ lib . "jon snow"
"hello jon snow"
```

Or named:

```shell
$ lib . --name "dolores abernathy"
"hello dolores abernathy"
```

Note that `context` is a magic parameter (automatically populated with
  execution details, when provided) as is `callback` (terminates execution),
  so these **don't need to be documented** and **can not be specified as
  parameters when executing the function**.

## Pushing to the Cloud

To push your function to a development environment in the cloud...

```shell
$ lib up dev
$ lib your-username.your-service[@dev]
"hello world"
```

And to release it (when you're ready!)

```shell
$ lib release
$ lib your-username.your-service
"hello world"
```

You can check out your service on the web, and use it in applications using our
functions gateway, `lib.id`.

```
https://functions.lib.id/your-username/your-service/
OR
https://your-username.lib.id/your-service/
```

That's it! You haven't written a line of code yet, and you have mastery over
building a service, testing it in a development (staging) environment online,
and releasing it for private (or public) consumption.

**Note:** You'll need to set `"publish": true` in the `lib` key of your
`package.json` file to see your service appear in the public registry. It's
set to `false` by default.

**Another Note:** Staging environments (like the one created with `lib up dev`)
are *mutable* and can be replaced indefinitely. Releases (`lib release`) are
*immutable* and can never be overwritten. However, any service can be torn down
with `lib down <environment>` or `lib down -r <version>` (but releases
	can't be replaced once removed, to prevent mistakes and / or bad actors).

# Connecting Service Endpoints

You'll notice that you can create more than one function per service. While
you can structure your project however you'd like internally, it should also
be noted that these functions have zero-latency access to each other. You
can access them internally with the `lib` [package on NPM](https://github.com/stdlib/lib-node),
which behaves similarly to the `lib` command for testing. Use:

```
$ npm install lib --save
```

In your main service directory to add it, and use it like so:

#### functions/add.js
```javascript
module.exports = (a = 0, b = 0, callback) => {
  return callback(null, a + b);
};
```

#### functions/add_double.js
```javascript
const lib = require('lib');

module.exports = (a = 0, b = 0, context, callback) => {
  return lib[`${context.service.identifier}.add`](a, b, (err, result) => {
    callback(err, result * 2);
  });
};
```

In this case, calling `lib .add 1 2` will return `3` and `lib .add_double 1 2`
will return `6`. The `context` magic parameter is used for its
`context.service.identifier` property, which will return the string `"your-username.your-service[@local]"`
in the case of local execution, `"your-username.your-service[@ENV]"` when deployed to an
environment or release (where `ENV` is your environment name or semver).

Note that `lib .add --a 1 --b 2` and
`lib .add_double --a 1 --b 2` are also perfectly valid, as is specifying keywords
via an object in the `add_double` function:

#### functions/add_double.js
```javascript
const lib = require('lib');

module.exports = (a = 0, b = 0, context, callback) => {
  return lib[`${context.service.identifier}.add`]({a: a, b: b}, (err, result) => {
    callback(err, result * 2);
  });
};
```

# Accessing Your Microservices From Other Applications

As mentioned in the previous section, you can use the NPM `lib` package that's
[available on GitHub and NPM](https://github.com/stdlib/lib-node) to access your
microservices from legacy Node.js applications and even the web browser. We'll
have more SDKs coming out in the following months.

An existing app would call a function (username.bestTrekChar with version 0.2.1):

```javascript
const lib = require('lib');

lib.username.bestTrekChar['@0.2.1']({name: 'spock'}, function (err, result) {

  if (err) {
    // handle it
  }

  // do something with result

});
```

Which would speak to your microservice...

```javascript
module.exports = (name = 'kirk', callback) => {

  if (name === 'kirk') {
    return callback(null, 'why, thank, you, too, kind');
  } else if (name === 'spock') {
    return callback(null, 'i think this feeling is called "pleased"');
  } else {
    return callback(new Error('Only kirk and spock supported.'));
  }

};
```

# Accessing Your Microservices Over HTTP

We definitely recommend using the [lib library on NPM](https://github.com/stdlib/lib-node)
to make microservice calls as specified above, but you can also make HTTPS
requests directly to the StdLib gateway. HTTP query parameters are mapped
automatically to parameters by name.

```
https://username.lib.id/liveService@1.12.2/?name=BATMAN
```

Maps directly to:

```javascript
/**
* Hello World
* @param {string} name
* @returns {string}
*/
module.exports = (name = 'world', callback) => {
  // returns "HELLO BATMAN" from above HTTP query
  callback(null, `Hello ${name}`);
};
```

# Running Your Microservices as Background Workers

To run any StdLib service as a background worker (immediately returns a
  response, runs function after), simply append ":bg" to the URL before
  the HTTP query parameters (search portion of the URL), for example (from
  above):

```
https://username.lib.id/liveService@1.12.2/:bg?name=BATMAN
```

To do so from the `lib-node` library, use:

```javascript
lib({bg: true}).username.liveService['@1.12.2'](...);
```

## Background Responses

The default background response will be a content type of `text/plain` with a
string indicating the function name you're executing. There are currently
three different options for background responses that you define before you
deploy your function.

### info (DEFAULT)

Set `@bg info` in your comment definition like so:

```javascript
/**
* Hello World
* @bg info
* @param {string} name
* @returns {string}
*/
module.exports = (name = 'world', callback) => {
  callback(null, `Hello ${name}`);
};
```

This is the default as well (if nothing is specified).

### empty

Set `@bg empty` in your comment definition like so:

```javascript
/**
* Hello World
* @bg empty
* @param {string} name
* @returns {string}
*/
module.exports = (name = 'world', callback) => {
  callback(null, `Hello ${name}`);
};
```

Will return an empty (0 length) response.

### params

Set `@bg params` in your comment definition like so:

```javascript
/**
* Hello World
* @bg params
* @param {string} name
* @returns {string}
*/
module.exports = (name = 'world', callback) => {
  callback(null, `Hello ${name}`);
};
```

This will return `{"name":"world"}` in this example (if no other parameters are
  specified) as this parameter has a default value. This will spit back any
  and all parameters sent to the function, even if they're not part of the
  function signature.

# Version Control and Package Management

A quick note on version control - StdLib is *not* a replacement for normal
git-based workflows, it is a supplement focused around service creation and
execution.

You have unlimited access to any release (that hasn't been torn down)
with `lib pkg <serviceIdentifier>` to download the tarball (`.tgz`) and
`lib get <serviceIdentifier>` to automatically download and unpack the
tarball to a working directory.

Tarballs (and package contents) are *closed-source*.
Nobody but you (and potentially your teammates) has access to these. It's up to
you whether or not you share the guts of your service with others on GitHub or NPM.

As mentioned above: releases are *immutable* and can not be overwritten (but can
	be removed, just not replaced afterwards) and development / staging environments
	are *mutable*, you can overwrite them as much as you'd like.

# Logging

Logging for services is enabled by default. When running a service locally with
`lib .` or `lib .functionname`, all logs will be output in your console. The very
last output (normally a JSON-compatible string) is the return value of the function.

To view remote logs (in dev or release environments), use the following syntax:

```shell
:: Lists all logs for the service
$ lib logs username.servicename

:: Lists main service endpoint logs for "dev" environment
$ lib logs username.servicename[@dev]

:: Lists service endpoint named "test" logs for "dev" environment
$ lib logs username.servicename[@dev].test

:: Lists all logs for "dev" environment
$ lib logs username.servicename[@dev]*
$ lib logs username.servicename[@dev].*
```

The default log type is `stdout`, though you can specify `stderr` with
`lib logs username.servicename -t stderr`.

Limit the number of lines to show with the `-l` argument (or `--lines`).

# Additional Functionality

StdLib comes packed with a bunch of other goodies - if your service goes down
for any reason (the service platform is acting up), use `lib restart`.
Similarly, as we roll out updates to the platform the builds we're using on
AWS Lambda may change. You can update your service to our latest build using
`lib rebuild`. We may recommend this from time-to-time, so pay attention
to e-mails and the community.

```
$ lib help
